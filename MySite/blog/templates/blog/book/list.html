    <p>
        This page is coming soon. It's a big project and I'll be modeling it off of
        <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books">Bill Gates' blog</a>
        because I think his looks pretty cool. Unfortunately, loading all of the images on this page
        is what makes the whole website take about 5 seconds to load when your first navigate to it.
        So I need to figure out how to fix that.
