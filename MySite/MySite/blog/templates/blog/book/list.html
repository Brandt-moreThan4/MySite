    <p>
        This page is coming soon. It's a big project and I'll be modeling it off of
        <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books">Bill Gates' blog</a>
        because I think his looks pretty cool. Would this look better if it was separated into multiple pages
        like the <a href="{% url 'blog:post_list'%}">Blog</a> page?
