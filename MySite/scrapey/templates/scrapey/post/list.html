                The following is an aggregated list of blogs that I think are fun which is updated with a python program to scrape
                the data from each site. My orginal plan for this project was to load the content of each 
                blog into a standardized and consolidated format for my personal consumption. My dream was that I would be
                able to print out a weekly document with my favorite blogs all together. Unfortunately, that was more difficult
                than I thought. Because the content of each site is written with the intent that it will be read with a web browser,
                it did not translate all that well when I tried to just copy the plain content and mash it together. So I settled
                on just copying the html for each post and re-generating it here on my site. There really isn't much of a point for
                doing that, and it's best to view each post at its original source (links to the soruces are included). I mainly just
                use this page as a way to browse through all of the post at once. I think it will be much more valuable once I update it
                with a filter and categorization functionality.
