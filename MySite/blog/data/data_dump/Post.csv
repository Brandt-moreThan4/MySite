8,Hedging Market Exposures,hedging-market-exposures,"The following are notes I made while reading the book """"Hedging Market Exposures: Identifying and Managing Market Risks"""" by Bychuk and Brian Haughey:

Page two and this book already has me thinking. It is discussing differences between intrinsic value and extrinsic value (the value the market assigns to an asset). It discusses the danger of assigning an intrinsic value to an asset with no cash flows. This is something that has always resonated with me as I was indoctrinated early on with the valuation mindset that something is only worthwhile if it produces cash flows. My thoughts here being that without cash flows to act as gravity for the asset you are only playing a pricing game and relying on the greater fool theory to make a return. There is a great deal of arrogance here on my part stemming from the belief that I, with proper diligence, could estimate these cash flows accurately and thus earn an attractive return regardless of what the short-term focused """"irrational market"""" believed. With this arrogance I said I did not want to be subject to the whims of market fads and fancies, but instead could count on my own intelligence. But this book has stirred the idea in me that I should at least think about a way to quantify future prices because extrinsic value may never align with intrinsic value. Supply and Demand equations? Some psychological interpretations? Technical analysis? I dunno, but I should certainly give these thoughts more weight as opposed to just scoffing at the idea of the pricing game, because it may be the only game in town. 
I think this books explanation of the mechanics of how Central Banks work is one of the best I have read. They seem to understand the market-based mechanics through which central banks work as opposed to just parroting on about how central banks are deciding to move interest rates around.  Pg. 8-9.
One beef I have is when the authors say it is foolish for portfolio managers to sacrifice long term performance for short term gains. Obviously as an idea I support this enthusiastically, but the example they give seems incorrect to me. They say it is unwise for institutional funds to lend securities they own to other firms or individuals for the purpose of short selling because it is stupid to support the actions of those seeking to depress the price of an asset you own. At first pass this sounds like a reasonable statement, but not after deeper thought. First issue is that I would imagine that it is extremely unlikely that the short sellers you are lending to will be shorting enough securities to have any sort of impact on the actual price of the security. Perhaps this is wrong, but I think I heard somewhere that a general rule of thumb was that you can trade 5% of the daily volume without impacting price. Highly doubtful that you are lending 5% of the daily volume of a security. Second issue is that even if they do impact the price so what? If you own the asset in your portfolio clearly you have a positive view on future returns of the asset and expect that the price will increase. (I guess technically this doesn't have to be true if the negatively correlated with the rest of your portfolio and the diversification benefits are enough to compensate you for the negative expected return). So, what happens if the short sellers affect the price? Maybe the asset declines in value by a whopping 10% (doubt it). But if you are confident in your analysis that the security was previously below its intrinsic value you are either indifferent or happy with this outcome from an objective standpoint. You can be indifferent in that you are confident this is just a short-term market irrationality which will inevitably correct itself in the long term. Alternatively, you may be thrilled because now you can purchase the security at a steeper discount than before and increase your expected return! In affect you created a bargain for yourself by encouraging the short sellers! I would say that this strategy is actually the opposite of what the authors propose. You are sacrificing short term returns and increasing volatility, but at the least having no effect on the long term outcome and actually increasing your total return on the investment because you are collecting income from the short sellers for the privilege of allowing them to borrow your asset. 
I really liked the idea that an asset model should not just """"spit out"""" one fundamental price, but instead provide a confidence interval for the estimate. This is a problem I typically have with analyst reports. It seems so absurd to me to have price targets to the decimal point and pretend like that's THE value of the asset that the market price must converge to. I believe Michael Mauboussin said one of his successful hedge fund friends forbids that their analyst give target prices for stocks and instead only allows them to discuss stock prices on an expected value approach with a whole probability distribution. I would add a little extra touch and say whatever your initial 95% confidence interval is you should increase it because as behavioral finance teaches us we are overconfident in our estimates. 
I also really like the idea that one of the great benefits of having a quantitative financial model is so that you can get a much better feel for the sensitivity of an asset to changes in the essential input parameters. The beauty of closed formed expressions is in their interpretability. An example I think most people can get behind and see the utility of is just a dividend discount model. It is a wonderful tool for helping you conceptualize how a stock can move and the magnitude of such moves. Just vary either the dividend, the growth rate, or required rate of return and observe. 
A concept that I believe I would struggle with immensely if I was forced to actually implement it is to treat my model as a """"black box"""" meaning that the inputs and parameters are uninterpretable. I just don't think I would be able to use a model I don't understand as it would make me too uncomfortable. Listening to Patrick's podcast I believe some of the guest he interviews discussed that this was a problem that resulted from machine learning where their algorithms produced models, but there would be 1000 variables and it was meaningless to interpret them. The pleasure of analysis is in the interpretation! I like to think I am pragmatic and that I will do what needs to be done regardless of how I feel, but I would struggle immensely relying on a model where I didn't understand the levers that impact the output.",2020-07-29 15:03:40+00:00,2020-07-28
10,More Than You Know,more-you-know,"The following are notes I made while reading the book """"More than You Know: finding Financials Wisdom in Unconventional Places"""" by Michael Mauboussin:

First and foremost: Michael Mauboussin is my hero. He's just great.
He gives a good example on the danger of expertise. The 10,000 hours rule which was discovered by Dr. Anders Ericsson and popularized by Malcom Gladwell basically said that if you practice at something for 10,000 hours you become an expert. There was more going on there both Gladwell and Ericsson have pushed back at the idea that it is that simple, but that is generally what is repeated by the masses. Mauboussin explains however that while thousands of hours of deliberate practice will certainly allow experts to internalize the nuances and particulars of their domain and even develop certain intuitions the downside is that it reduces cognitive flexibility. You get stuck on the ideas that you have repeatedly fed into your mind and you may be numb to changing circumstance or will not test your long held beliefs frequently enough as they are not just a part of your thinking.
""""Valuation depends on your time horizon."""" Preach. I have been thinking about this for a while and also the idea that taxes maybe affect your personal valuation?
The Dow 36,000 was wrong because they assumed everyone would adopt a long-term time horizon and the equity risk premium would disappear and people would be willing to pay much more for stocks. Michael says this is wrong because it assumes investor homogeneity, but markets needs investor diversity. Why?",2020-07-16 15:04:25.129412+00:00,2020-07-16
9,Descartes Error,descartes-error,"The following are notes I made while reading the book """"Descartes Error"""" by Antonio Damasio:

So somatic markers are pretty interesting. Unfortunately I do not know it well enough to give an explanation I am confident in, but I generally think about somatic markers simply as emotional impressions your mind/body/brain makes on certain events that guides future decisions or thoughts made by your mind/body/brain.

A good example I think to illustrate the benefits of somatic marking is the study done where participants were put through a simulated gambling game. There are some nuances there, but the basic design of the game is that a participant has to choose a card between multiple card decks repeatedly and the payoff they receive is dependent on the card they draw. Some of the decks are weighted with positive expected value outcome and some will yield a negative expected outcome if repeated cards are chosen.  The payoffs can be complex enough and their responses are required fast enough so that the participants cannot rationally or analytically think through which deck has the positive expected outcome, but the fun result is that people learn rather quickly which decks are optimal and begin choosing from those decks exclusively. The theory being that their somatic markers have left negative impressions on the shitty decks and positive vibes on the better decks which leads to optimal decision making. People with certain emotional brain deficiencies, but who are still intelligent and analytically capable fail at this task because they do not benefit from the somatic markings.

Prospect theory is pretty popular and the crux of it is that losses hurt more than gains and therefore humans are loss averse.

The connection I was pondering would be something along the lines of: Prospect theory tells us how we can expect to feel and the somatic marker hypothesis tells us how we internalize those feelings and how they are incorporated into our decision making.

Throughout our life as we experience gains and losses in life more generally, but specifically with our investments our somatic markers are making constant impressions on us that impact our subsequent choices. Every time we experience a positive return because of a decision we made that decision is marked positively which is cool, but when we have bad decisions these are given strong negative markings that carry more weight than the positives. The importance these markers have is that they shape our future thinking. The somatic markers are used as a first pass filter for our brain to weed out a lot of the noise which allows us to focus on a subset of all possible thoughts. At first our thoughts are only exposed to things that have passed this first pass filter and if we want to dig further we have to make a very concerted effort to broaden our thinking which is not natural for most people. I think the importance and impact of these markings should be obvious because they literally shape our thoughts.
A hypothetical example of somatic marking at work could be people's general attitude towards the stock market. Think about a young, intelligent professional, possibly an engineering graduate with a decent job who was 27 in the year 2000. Let's assume they were a disciplined individual who saved more than they spent over the first 4 years of their professional careers and invested their excess money into the stock market like a responsible young adult because that is what their advisor told them to do. Unfortunately shit hit the fan and things went bust. Perhaps this individual even had the majority of their portfolio in tech stocks because their advisor said they were young and should assume more risk. The unfortunate consequence is that this individual lost over 60% of their recently acquired wealth. Obviously, this would be a bummer, but the real lasting consequence is the impression this experience left on said person. Prospect theory tells us that they were traumatized by this drawdown and the somatic marker hypothesis says that this event was ingrained deep into their psyche. This person most likely now holds a deep bias against the stock market and will most likely not invest again for a while if ever. 

So, I don't know if that example really exemplifies somatic marking at work in the way I was originally thinking, so that's my bad. I was thinking more along smaller/frequent decisions individuals make that are more easily driven through emotional impressions so I should try to think of more examples.
But I guess I would say one of the main ideas that I should flesh out a bit more here is that context is everything as usual. Somatic marking can be powerful and useful in some situations and yet produce sub-optimal outcomes in others. 

I know I am probably incorrectly applying both prospect theory and somatic marking, but it was fun to think about anyway.",2020-07-16 15:03:57+00:00,2020-07-21
7,Intuition,intuition,"The following are notes I made while reading the book """"Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic"""" by Osho:

On the first page I knew reading the book was going to be a challenge for me because it starts off explaining the idea that intuition is not something that can be learned, but just sort of felt. My own view has generally been quite the opposite and practically everything I do is done with the end goal of developing and honing my intuition to become a more effective and efficient tool. For example, think about reading. Like most people I don't think I remember most of what I read except for perhaps the most salient facts or stories, but that is not the true benefit of broad and deep reading in my opinion. Through extensive reading my hope is to continually train my intuition by providing it with more and more ideas and concepts that I may not remember in their entirety, but the fundamentals of the ideas will still influence the way I think. To state in another way, I hope to use my system 2 brain to feed my body with enough ideas so that my system 1 brain which is much quicker and more efficient can recognize patterns it has seen before. The purpose really being that there is great utility in having a high-powered system 1 thinking as there are a lot of situations where speed is paramount, and first gut reactions are beneficial. I believe Patrick Oshaughnessy described intuition as nothing more than pattern recognition and that the recognition software your brain is equipped with has been shaped by the experiences you have.  A fun and fictional example of pattern recognition at work is in the stories of Sherlock Holmes that I have been reading. Sherlock has spent and still spends a vast majority of his time reading the reports of every criminal case he can get his hands on and reads newspaper reports of every mysterious case there is. His rational is that humans are similar enough that the crimes we commit are generally just variations of others that have occurred before. This means that for the vast majority of cases he sees he can identify what has occurred nearly instantly after gathering the data from the crime. Similar I think to how Warren Buffet is able to make 2 minute, multibillion dollar deals because he has spent his entire life reading about businesses so when a seemingly new opportunity comes before him it can seem ridiculous that he is able to make such snap decisions. In reality that snap decision is founded on years of preparation and knowledge about similar deals.

It appears I am getting a little off topic here and hopefully my initial disagreements are not simply a matter of semantics. Perhaps what Osho defines as intuition is different from my understanding. It may be that when I use the word intuition, I am referring to just an altered form of what Osho thinks of as the disdainful 'intellect'. I think this book is going to be quite difficult for me to internalize in the way that Osho would like because he describes intuition as something that cannot be understood by intelligence and if I know myself I am going to try to reason through the entire book and likely miss the point of what he is trying to say. 

So, my post read thoughts are not too much different than initial feelings. I guess you could say that my intuition told me it would not really be a book for me, and it was correct. Haha. Maybe I will be able to appreciate this book and the concepts contained if I re-read it at some point later in life when I have more experiences, but for now, it just did not click. I need to reason my way through everything and that is not something generally encouraged by my man Osho.",2020-07-16 15:03:27+00:00,2020-07-21
6,The Ascent of Money,ascent-money,"The following are notes I made while reading the book """"The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World"""" by Nial Ferguson:

Ideas sparked from the first few chapters.
Finance amplifies our natural differences. Leverage of our innate talents and abilities. Finance moralizes. It made you more likely to trade with a stranger in the forest than bash his head in. To understand finance, you need to understand either the problems it solves, or service it provides, or utility it delivers.
One idea I found enjoyable and thought provoking is that finance amplifies our innate talents and abilities. Leverage! 
I certainly enjoyed the notion that commerce essentially acted as a moralizer for civilization. In the olden days if you were living your life as a hunter-gatherer exploring the jungle and you happened across a stranger in the forest a probable outcome from such an encounter is that one of you winds up dead. Along comes the notion of trading and instead of violence your first thought turns toward a mutually beneficial exchange of goods! People's desire for trade facilitates more amicable interactions among strangers. 
Another way the engine of finance powered society forward is through the introduction of record keeping which served as the origins for written language and record keeping. The first documents created were essentially accounting records business owners used to keep track of their assets and business transactions. Who owed who what and how much and when and where and such. It was upon this foundation that written language was born as people increasingly appreciated the benefits of documentation. I don't think it is all that necessary to delve into a formal appreciation for the impact language has had on society... but it is a lot.",2020-07-16 15:03:09.476689+00:00,2020-07-16
5,Manager Style,manager-style,"Are small sized money managers or big preferred? Sector specific or broad?
Probably the commonsense view on this matter is that a sector specific fund would be preferred to one that juggles a wide variety of investment opportunities. This view follows straightforward from the idea that if they spend all their time analyzing a narrow topic then the expertise, they will develop in that area will be extreme allowing them to generate alpha. Make sense obviously, but I do tend to lean towards the views of the generalist than specialist. Being a generalist can usually give you unique insight into specific areas because you are able to access a more diverse set of mental models based on your eclectic knowledge base. I would also think that being a specialist can make you a bit myopic to new points of view and you may get bogged down in the details while losing focus on the broader perspective.",2020-07-16 15:02:40.892722+00:00,2020-07-16
4,Investment Execution-2,investment-execution-2,"To briefly touch on yesterday's issue, assuming that you should not invest all of your money into that one mispriced security how much money should you invest?
Probably the easiest way to think about it for me, at least initially, would be to use a standard mean-variance framework. Essentially you do all the normal stuff: using data on expected returns, variances, and covariances you construct a portfolio with the highest possible sharp ratio and invest in that portfolio however much your risk preferences dictate. The only real change needed to the framework is that you adjust the expected return on the mispriced security to account for the mispricing. Would you adjust the variance and covariance estimates? I don't know. Obviously, the implementation of this would be trickier and there are surely nuances that I am ignoring in this quick solution, but I think this is probably a decent way to at least begin to think of how much to allocate in your portfolio. Only problem is that it doesn't have a """"feel-good"""" intuition to back it up really, but that tends to be the case using any methodology that isn't strictly fundamental/ story driven.",2020-07-16 15:02:21.950773+00:00,2020-07-16
3,Investment Execution,investment-execution,"If you know with 100% certainty that a security is undervalued should you put all your money into it?
I would think not. When you say """"undervalued"""" you are saying that given this security's cash flows and the uncertainty of these cash flows its value should be X, but it currently trading for X - Y. Where Y is the dollar amount of the mispricing. At first pass this may seem to be an arbitrage opportunity of sorts and it typically is presented as such, but the only way this is a true arbitrage is if after buying at (X-Y) you could immediately sell for X. Then you may think that since your valuation is correct with 100% accuracy that eventually the mispricing will be corrected, and you will make a beautiful profit. This reasoning calls to mind Keynes famous quote """"The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent."""" Or another familiar phrase of """"Being too early is indistinguishable from being wrong."""" Both quotes make clear the possible complications and risk associated with such an investment.
 I think being a little more concrete is probably beneficial and can help elucidate the point. 
First, even if your valuation at time T is correct if that mispricing does not occur by time T+1 and you must sell at T+1 then you are screwed. This is the point Keynes was whining about. Although you were correct, you were not able to cash out on your brilliance before the day of reckoning so your insight went to waste. 
Another possibility is that at time T+1 the valuation has changed just because of the uncertainty of life. Events in the world have changed and now you again accurately value the security, but unfortunately its value has decreased by Z dollars where Z>Y. In this case your valuation is now lower than the market value you purchased at! To compound on these tough circumstances, imagine the market suddenly realizes its mistake and values the security at the correct value of X-Z. In this case even though you were 100% correct you were still screwed. 
The conclusion I must take away is that diversification is paramount to investment success. The only way to assure your success, assuming you can have the skill to consistently identify mispricing's is if would be if you can bet on hundreds of these mispricing's throughout your life so that the variance washes out and your average profit is in fact (X-Y).",2020-07-16 15:01:57.423391+00:00,2020-07-16
2,Friends in WW I,friends-ww-i,"Reading the book ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky I came across a fascinating story. I am really fuzzy on the actual details, but the gist of it involves the tacit cooperation of enemies during trench warfare in WW1. 
This cooperation consisted of agreements made by foot soldiers on opposing sides, under the noses of superior officers, for a period of pretend fighting. An example of such a truce would be if a French Sharpshooter unloaded a few well-aimed shots on some object conspicuously nearby to German soldiers to suggest that the sniper has the ability, but not the desire to take their life. In return a German sharpshooter could repay the gesture by also firing a few well-placed shots on an object near French soldiers. After this encounter word would spread amongst the foot soldiers that a truce has been established, leading to a period of lackluster effort and poorly aimed shots. This would continue until superior officer caught on and set things straight.",2020-07-16 15:01:40.088787+00:00,2020-07-16
1,Corporate Profits,corporate-profits,"Currently reading CFA level 2 economic material. In particular the discussion on economic growth has stimulated a lot of thought. There is mention of the obvious, but I think not frequently discussed concept of corporate profits as a percent of GDP. Typically you think that aggregate earnings for companies would grow in stride with the economy as whole, but there can certainly be a divergance between earnings growth and GDP if there is a shift in the share of profits that companies' claim from total GDP. Graph below shows how this metric has evolved over time. 


What drives this number? Corporate power? Unions? Social sentiment? Composition of stock ownership? Labor skill levels? Physical capital? Seems like it would be a pretty cool variable to understand on a deep level. Could potentially facilitate comprehending of short to mid-term market movements. Probably would not be as useful for lengthy forecast as presumably there is a long run equilibrium value.

Completely unrelated, but today I also heard the best analogy so far for what classes are. Memory on your computer is a pile of cookie dough. The class is a cookie cutter. An instance of the class means you just take a scoop of the cookie dough and apply the cookie cutter to it. Then with that individual template you can add all sorts of sprinkles and icings or whatever bells and whistles you want.
