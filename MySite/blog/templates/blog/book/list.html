    <p>
        This page is coming soon. It's a big project and I'll be modeling it off of
        <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books">Bill Gates' blog</a>
        because I think his looks pretty cool. Would this look better if it was separated into multiple pages
        like the <a href="{% url 'blog:post_list'%}">Blog</a> page?
    </p>

         <div class="row">
            {% for book in books %}         
                <div class="book-container col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
                    <a href="/">
                        <img class="book-image" src=
                             "{% with 'blog/Images/Books/'|add:book.image_name as image_static %}
                                    {% static image_static %}
                              {% endwith %}" />                             
                    </a>
                    <div class="cover-description">
                        {{ book.cover_description }} 
                    </div>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}   
        </div>
